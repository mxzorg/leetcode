# 1. Two Sum
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.


# 2. Add Two Numbers 

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)

Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8


# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters 

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Examples:

Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.

Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.


# 5. Longest Palindromic Substring 

Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.


# 7. Reverse Integer 

Reverse digits of an integer.

Example1: x = 123, return 321

Example2: x = -123, return -321 


# 8. String to Integer (atoi) 

Implement atoi to convert a string to an integer.

Hint: Carefully consider all possible input cases. If you want a challenge, please do not see below and ask yourself what are the possible input cases.

Notes: It is intended for this problem to be specified vaguely (ie, no given input specs). You are responsible to gather all the input requirements up front. 


# 9. Palindrome Number 

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.


# 11. Container With Most Water 

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2. 


# 12. Integer to Roman 

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.


# 13. Roman to Integer 

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.


# 14. Longest Common Prefix

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings. 

# 20. Valid Parentheses

Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

The brackets must close in the correct order, "()" and "()[]{}" are all valid but "(]" and "([)]" are not.


# 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists 

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
