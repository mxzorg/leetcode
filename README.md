分享LeetCode上问题解答方案


## [1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.


## [2. Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/description/)

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)

Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8


## [3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/)

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Examples:

Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.

Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.


## [5. Longest Palindromic Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/description/)

Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.


## [7. Reverse Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/description/)

Reverse digits of an integer.

Example1: x = 123, return 321

Example2: x = -123, return -321 


## [8. String to Integer (atoi)](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi/description/)

Implement atoi to convert a string to an integer.

Hint: Carefully consider all possible input cases. If you want a challenge, please do not see below and ask yourself what are the possible input cases.

Notes: It is intended for this problem to be specified vaguely (ie, no given input specs). You are responsible to gather all the input requirements up front. 


## [9. Palindrome Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/description/)

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.


## [11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/description/)

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2. 


## [12. Integer to Roman](https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-to-roman/description/)

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.


## [13. Roman to Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/description/)

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.


## [14. Longest Common Prefix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/description/)

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings. 

## [20. Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/description/)

Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

The brackets must close in the correct order, "()" and "()[]{}" are all valid but "(]" and "([)]" are not.


## [21. Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/description/)

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists. 

## [26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/description/)

Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

## [27. Remove Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/description/)

Given an array and a value, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

## [28. Implement strStr()](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-strstr/description/)

Implement strStr().

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

## [35. Search Insert Position](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/description/)

Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You may assume no duplicates in the array.

## [53. Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/description/)

Find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum.

## [58. Length of Last Word](https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-last-word/description/)

Given a string s consists of upper/lower-case alphabets and empty space characters ' ', return the length of last word in the string.

If the last word does not exist, return 0.

Note: A word is defined as a character sequence consists of non-space characters only.

## [66. Plus One](https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one/description/)

Given a non-negative integer represented as a non-empty array of digits, plus one to the integer.

You may assume the integer do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list.

## [67. Add Binary](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-binary/description/)

Given two binary strings, return their sum (also a binary string).
